       <h3>3.- Inspirations</h3>
       <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 20px">In stories, they are often based on facts or ideas from life, in which it helps us to express what we want to do to show the reader something, which will be shown in this part of the content section.</p>
       <h4>Yesterday's Dream</h4>
       <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 20px">The inspirations to make this story are mainly me, my sister and my relationship with her, but also a childhood friend who was in love with her. My sister supports me in anything and helps me a lot, although I also help her a lot, I think we are both the same in this aspect, that is what inspired me to do the deep theme of the story. My childhood friend inspired me to make the appearance, personality and love relationship of the protagonist, which gives us good chemistry when combining these aspects.</p>
